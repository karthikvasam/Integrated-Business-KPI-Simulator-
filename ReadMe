Integrated Business KPI Simulator (Power BI):

An interactive business analytics dashboard built using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python** to visualize and simulate key performance indicators (KPIs) — **Revenue**, **Cost**, **Customer Experience**, and **Risk**.  
The project demonstrates how changes in pricing, cost, or operational factors influence revenue growth, customer retention, and risk exposure through dynamic data-driven insights.

Project Overview:
The **Integrated Business KPI Simulator** models the relationships among four major business pillars:
- Revenue & Growth** – Tracks income, sales, and conversion performance.  
- Cost & Efficiency** – Measures operational expenses and profit margins.  
- Customer Experience** – Monitors churn rate, retention, and satisfaction (NPS).  
- Risk & Compliance** – Evaluates fraud, downtime, and process stability.  

Users can adjust parameters such as price or cost through Power BI’s *What-If* sliders to simulate various business scenarios and instantly observe the impact on overall performance metrics.

Features:
- Interactive What-If Simulation** – Adjust KPIs dynamically to test multiple business outcomes.  
- KPI Correlation Analysis** – Understand how revenue, cost, and customer metrics are inter-linked.  
- Real-Time Insights** – View live updates to profitability, retention, and risk levels.  
- SQL-Based Data Modeling** – Used joins and aggregations to integrate financial, customer, and risk datasets.  
- Python-Generated Data** – Created and cleaned datasets using Pandas and NumPy for realistic patterns.  
- Professional Visualization** – Power BI dashboards designed with clean, decision-oriented layouts.

Workflow:
1. Data Simulation: Generate sample business data using Python.  
2. Database Integration: Store structured data and join tables in SQL.  
3. Dashboard Design: Import into Power BI and create relationships between datasets.  
4. Parameter Setup: Add *What-If* parameters for price, cost, and satisfaction.  
5. Visualization: Build interactive visuals for revenue, churn, profit, and risk.  
6. Insight Delivery: Analyze outcomes to derive actionable recommendations.

key Insights:
- Demonstrates trade-offs between profitability, customer satisfaction, and operational risk.  
- Highlights how **data analytics enables strategic decision-making** through simulation.  
- Shows integration of **technical (SQL/Python)** and **business intelligence (Power BI)** skills.
